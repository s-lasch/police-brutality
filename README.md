## Background
Over the past two decades, there has been a steady increase in fatal U.S. police shootings. Whether these incidents make national news or not, data shows that the trend is sloped upward for fatal police shootings all across the country. The data used in this project spans from the years 2000-2021, and includes over 10,000 records of individuals that have been fatally shot by police, though this number continues to climb.
